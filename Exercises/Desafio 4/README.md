# Challenge 4
This challenge is the challenge of the fourth module of the Launchbase Bootcamp of Rocketseat. In this challenge, was requested that a website with a header containing two links that should have a transition :hover and a ::after. Also was necessary to use the + logic in css.
Later was added a card with the information of the teacher, with all its details.
In challenge 4.3, it was added the option to view and to edit a teacher that was already in the data.json.
The last challenges added the delete function, with an confirmation, the index showing all the teachers and allowing to see each individual teacher if the side button was clicked (all the teachers were listed within a table), a "create new teacher" button and some other minor features.
All these were also replicated to the students section of the website.

Please note that the challenge "Foodfy" is separated in another repository!
