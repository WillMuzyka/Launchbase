# Challenge 3.3
This challenge is the third challenge of the third module of the Launchbase Bootcamp of Rocketseat.
In this challenge, was requested that instead of the modal pop-up when clicking on an image/recipe, the server would send another page.
This page contains all the information of ingredients, method and additional information about the recipe.
The biggest challenges are making everything work properly while maintaining the aesthetics of the page, for example: the Show/Hide button.

The full description of the challenge can be accessed at (in portuguese):
