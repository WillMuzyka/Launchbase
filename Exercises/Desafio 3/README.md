# Challenge 3
This challenge is the challenge of the third module of the Launchbase Bootcamp of Rocketseat.
This list of challenges is to build the same website from challenge 2, but now all the information is given to the front-end from the back-end. This was made with express, nunjucks and other packages.
In this challenge, was requested that instead of the modal pop-up when clicking on an image/recipe, the server would send another page.
This page contains all the information of ingredients, method and additional information about the recipe.
The biggest challenges are making everything work properly while maintaining the aesthetics of the page, for example: the Show/Hide button.

The full description of the list of challenges (3.1 to 3.3) can be accessed at(in portuguese):
Please note that the challenge "Foodfy" is separated in another repository!
